Breve.js - A McGyver toolbox of small bits to speed up vanilla js development / prototyping, especially of toys.

Features: mixing and inheritance, custom events, uuid, debounce and throttle, and, as a pure flight of fancy, a polyfill for requestAnimationFrame. It's intentionally basic and conceived for convenience and speed, not abundance of features.
